Package: saeTrafo
Title: Transformations for unit-level small area models
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Nora Würz [aut]
Maintainer: Nora Würz <nora.wuerz@fu-berlin.de>
Description: The package supports methodology for the estimation of small area 
means using unit-level models under transformations. Besides established small 
area methods, saeTrafo supports new methods to enable the estimation of small 
area means with unit-level models in the simultaneous presence of 
transformations and limited auxiliary data. saeTrafo supplies the log and the 
data-driven log-shift transformation. An automatic selection of the appropriate 
methodology ensures user-friendliness and the respective uncertainty estimates 
are offered. Tools for creating plots (model validation and assessment of the 
estimators), visualisation on maps and exporting to Excel and OpenDocument 
Spreadsheets are provided.
